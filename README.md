🚀 Showcasing My Latest Power BI Project: Data Professionals Insight Dashboard

I created this interactive dashboard using real survey data to provide meaningful insights into the world of data professionals. Key highlights of the dashboard include:
📍 Country Representation: Geographic distribution of survey participants
💼 Average Salaries: Comparison of job roles like Data Scientist, Data Engineer, and more
😊 Happiness Scores: Work-life balance and salary satisfaction levels
🔍 Breaking Into Data: Insights into how challenging it is to enter the field
💻 Programming Preferences: Popular programming languages among data professionals
🌐 Industry Breakdown: Job roles across industries like Tech, Finance, and Healthcare

This project illustrates how data storytelling can help uncover valuable trends in the data field. Power BI was instrumental in turning raw data into actionable visuals.
